1. Download and install Git on your system: https://git-scm.com/download

2. Configuring Git

After installing Git, you can also configure it - most importantly, you can set a username and email address that will be connected to all your code snapshots.

- This can be done via:
```
git config --global user.name "your-username"
git config --global user.email "your-email"
```
You can learn more about Git's configuration options here: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config
